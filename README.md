# High-Power-Performance-2.0
CodeLouisville Project designed to test students skills in creating their own website. 

These files contain the codes to HTML, CSS,and JavaScript to High Power Performance, a business site for a pair of in-training mechanics. A side index and links in the footer will take you from the home page to the three other pages that are needed for the beginnings of a business.

As these files are still rough around the edges and unofficially published, it is highly recommended that you download a coding program such as Visual Studio Code or Brackets to review the codes.
